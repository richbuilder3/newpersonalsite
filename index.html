    Prior to moving back to Detroit in 2016, Richard entered the tech world as a Michigan State University Alum looking to switch careers for better opportunities. 
    He started, by quitting his previous job with a fortune 10 company, taking all of his savings, moving to New York and enrolling in a 3-month coding boot camp. During that program, his eyes were opened to the opportunities that a background in technology and design-thinking could bring to not only himself but his community. 
    After years of volunteering as a coding instructor on the east coast while working as a software development project manager, he decided to move back to Detroit to help expose his own community to the opportunities in tech. 
    In 2016, JOURNi was selected as a My Brother’s Keeper Detroit Innovation Challenge Winner. This Award, along with a paid internship program that JOURNi facilitated for 25 students through GDYT served as the catalyst for JOURNi to expand their program throughout Detroit. 
    
    Richard continues to help build confidence in his student’s to create while pursuing their passions.
